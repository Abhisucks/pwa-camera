# PWA Camera

A progressive web app (PWA) with camera feature offers users the ability to control the device camera within the web application. This feature enables users to open and close the camera as well as capture photos directly from within the app.

When a user opens the camera feature within the PWA, they will be presented with a camera preview screen. From here, they can adjust camera settings such as flash and camera orientation. They can then capture a photo by tapping the "capture" button, which takes a photo using the device's camera.

Once the user has captured the photo, they can choose to either save it or discard it. If the user decides to save it, the photo will be stored in the device's photo gallery, and the user can continue using the camera or close it to return to the main app.

To close the camera feature within the PWA, users can either tap the "close" button, which will immediately close the camera without saving the current photo, or they can swipe down on the camera preview screen to dismiss it.

Overall, the camera feature in a PWA provides users with the convenience of accessing their device's camera within the app, allowing them to take photos quickly and easily. With the ability to open and close the camera and capture photos, users have complete control over the camera experience, making it an essential feature for any PWA that relies on visual content.
